## Requirements

- node
- npm
- Patience & Creativity

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Deploying

This project usses github actions to deploy onto Cloudflare with every code change.

1. Make sure secrets are set for the following variables:

- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`
- `CLOUDFLARE_AUTHOR_ID`

[Instructions on how to obtain these are here](https://github.com/cloudflare/pages-action).

2. Make sure Github Actions permissions is set to Read and Write using a `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
