## Requirements

- node
- npm
- Patience & Creativity

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Deploying

[![Deploy](https://github.com/shivan-s/Codejam-Site/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/shivan-s/Codejam-Site/actions/workflows/main.yml)

This project usses github actions to deploy onto Cloudflare with every code change.

1. Make sure secrets are set for the following variables:

- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`
- `CLOUDFLARE_AUTHOR_ID`
