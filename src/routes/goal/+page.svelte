<p>
	The goal of this CodeJam is to challenge ourselves to build something engaging to share with
	others, ideally with others, andâ€¦ to make it as fun as possible. ðŸ˜€ Itâ€™s an opportunity to
	exercise skills in collaboration, creativity, and learning. How does it feel to work in a team? I
	donâ€™t know - letâ€™s find out!
</p>

<p>
	Can we learn from each other? Can we improve each otherâ€™s resourcefulness? If one person improves
	as a developer, or if a new friendship is made, we would be so happy and consider this event a
	success. As a bonus, maybe we can add a new project to our resume and gain a new network that
	lasts beyond this event. :)
