		The goal of this CodeJam is to challenge ourselves to build something engaging to share with
		others, ideally with others, and… to make it as fun as possible. 😀 It’s an opportunity to
		exercise skills in collaboration, creativity, and learning. How does it feel to work in a team?
		I don’t know - let’s find out!
	</p>
	<br />

	<p>
		Can we learn from each other? Can we improve each other’s resourcefulness? If one person
		improves as a developer, or if a new friendship is made, we would be so happy and consider this
		event a success. As a bonus, maybe we can add a new project to our resume and gain a new network
		that lasts beyond this event. :)
